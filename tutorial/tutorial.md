# PhysLabJs

PhysLabJS is a small HTML/CSS/JavaScript application to create one or more small systems made of spheres interacting in a 2D plane. The interaction choosen is a simularione (very simplified) of a bidimesional attractive force.

It is made for fun only, it is not intende to be used for educational purposes.

Made with [Konva.js](https://konvajs.org/).

This is an example a small sistema made with 2 bodies:

| Add | Add a new body tothe system |
| Load | Load the systems from the _local storage_ |
| Save | Save the systems in the _local storage_ |
| Start | Start the interaction |
| Stop | Stop the interaxtion |
